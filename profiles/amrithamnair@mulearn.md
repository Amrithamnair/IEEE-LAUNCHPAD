### About Me

I'm someone who loves finding meaning in the small things- whether its a deep conversation, a quite moment with music, or a random adventure that turns into a lasting memory.
I'm curious by nature, always eager to learn, grow, and understand the world and people around me. I care deeply about those close to me
and try to bring honesty, warmth, and loyalty into every relationship I have.



#### Leadership and Influence:

I meet the requirements of being a leader and influencer in my domain by consistently demonstrating initiative, vision, and 
a commitment to growth-not just for myself, but for those around me. 

#### Networking:

- Networking is about genuine connection. My approach is simple: listen, learn, and be present. I enjoy getting to know people-
- their stories, passions, and challenges- and I try to build relationships based on mutual respect and trust.
  

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala has always been a land of ideas, talent, and resilience- and that gives a unique edge when it comes to buliding a thriving
startup ecosystem. The state already has a strong foudation: high literacy, a deep-rooted culture of learning, and a growing
network of innovators and thinkers.


#### History of Open Source Contributions:

-  I don't personally have open source projects like an individual developer might. However, I'm deeply connected to the world
-  of open source contributions- innovations from research groups, developers, and communinities worldwide have helped shape
-  the frameworks and ideas I work with.
-  
#### History of Community Engagement:

- While I haven't built a public track record on any platforms, my commitment to technical community engagement has always been genuine and personal.
- I've long admired the spirit of open collaboration- where sharing knowledge and problem- solving together takes center stage.


#### Highly Used Software Tools:

I haven't developed any widely used software tools.
